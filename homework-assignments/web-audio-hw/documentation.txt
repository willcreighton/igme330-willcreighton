I. Project Overview

II. Audio Effect Nodes

    A. Audio Effect Node 1 - Bass
        1. Description: I added a Bass node to the app for the first additional audio effect.
        2. Parameters: Starting at the value 0, users can slide between -50 and 50 for this
           node. I found these values to be the best balance of fun and bearable.

    B. Audio Effect Node 2 - Treble
        1. Description: I added a Treble node to the app for the second additional audio effect.
        2. Parameters: Starting at the value 0, users can slide between -30 and 30 for this
           node. After continued testing, I found these values to be the most usable.
